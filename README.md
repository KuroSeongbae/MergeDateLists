# MergeDateLists

## The problem:
You have a parent and a child list of Items. Items have a Begin and End date and an ID.
Both lists need to be merged, so that there is only one element/item per period. Child Items aren't allowed to be changed in Begin and End date.
Parent Items can be altered, chopped and splitted so they fit in between.
